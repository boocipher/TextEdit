## Description
**TextEdit** is a single-page in-browser full stack progressive web application (PWA) that allows developers to write and save code. It features a number of data presistence techniques that provide redundancy and the ability to use the application offline.


## Installation
You can install this text editor by clicking the *Install!* button in the upper left corner (see screenshot below). Next, you will need to navigate to the Crome Apps directory in your computer and start it from there.


## Usage
Add your code snippets below the *JATE* header and click outside of the code lines in order to save them.
